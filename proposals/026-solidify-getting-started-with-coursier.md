# Solidify Getting Started with Coursier

## Proposer

Proposed by Chris Kipp (Lunatech) and Rob Norris (Typelevel) 06-08-2021

## Abstract

Coursier has become a tool that every Scala developer depends on, either directly or indirectly. 
It packs an incredibly impressive feature set. With the
addition of the `cs setup` functionality it's no surprise that Coursier is becoming an
increasingly popular option, not only to set up the common Scala toolchain,
but also to maintain Java versions and to launch applications. Coursier has
transitioned from a power-user tool to a tool that is now possibly the first
Scala tool encountered by a newcomer to the language.

With that in mind, contrasting the user experience with other common tools used
for similar purposes, Coursier is lagging behind. With an overwhelming
help menu (see `cs java -h`), varying installation instructions found on the
Scala website, and unclear details about what exact versions and specific
launchers (`sbt` for example) are being installed, it brings unnecessary
confusion to the Getting Started experience.

## Proposal

There are a few concrete things we can do ensure that the Getting Started experience is a
positive one.

### 1. Unify the Scala website installation instructions

Currently, depending on which part of the site the user is on, she will see different
instructions about how to get started.

#### Examples

- The [Scala 3 Download Page](https://scala-lang.org/download/scala3.html) 
    mentions Coursier as one of the easiest ways to get started with
    Scala. However, there is no mention of `cs setup` and instead simply
    mentions using it to install `scala3-compiler` and `scala3-repl`. This
    already causes confusion for newcomers. Which do I install? Which do I need?
    What if I don't have Java installed?
- The [Scala 2 Download Page](https://scala-lang.org/download/scala2.html) does not mention Coursier, 
    but instead tells the user to install either sbt or IntelliJ
    to get started. Furthermore there is another section that mentions SDKMAN!,
    MacPorts, Brew, and directly downloading the binaries as alternative ways to
    install Scala.
- The [Getting Started Page for Scala 2](https://docs.scala-lang.org/getting-started/index.html) 
    and [Getting Started Page for Scala 3](https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/getting-started.html) 
    do use `cs setup`, but the pages are inconsistent in wording.

#### Potential solution

If Coursier is indeed the recommended way to get started with Scala, ensure that the official
documentation points to it and includes a link to reference documentation (such as Alex Archambault's
[fantastic
article](https://alexarchambault.github.io/posts/2020-09-21-cs-setup.html) about
`cs setup`).

In most cases simply downloading Scala is not what users need to do. We suggest that these pages be
de-emphasized in favor of Getting Started.

### 2. Improve the Courser CLI user experience.

The help options in Coursier can be overwhelming and it's often unclear if all of
the options are actually relevant for a user. It's also impossible to see the
versions of an application the user has installed via Coursier and is difficult to
parse some of the very long output.

#### Examples

- When using `cs java -h` the user is met with almost 50 options. Some also seem to
    be irrelevant for setting up Java. To name a few: `--sbt-plugin-hack`,
    `--log-changing`, `--drop-info-attr`. Compared to other common tools to
    install Java such as [SDKMAN!](https://sdkman.io/), this is quite
    overwhelming. I'll include the full output of both options below to further
    illustrate.

#### Potential solution

Do some initial research on other common CLI tools in various language
ecosystems to get inspiration on a cleaner user experience. Possibly draw
some inspiration from SKDMAN! as it's a popular alternative to Coursier to
manage Java versions. After the initial research there will need to be
changes made to the CLI module of Coursier and possibly even
[`case-app`](https://github.com/alexarchambault/case-app), which is the library
Coursier uses for the CLI.

### 3. Clarify and agree on the applications in `cs setup`

It's not always clear what exact application is being installed. sbt is a great
example of this when installed with Coursier. Also, how is the default
applications determined for Coursier?

#### Examples

- While this could be an entire proposal on its own, there are multiple
    sbt launchers that are floating around the ecosystem. When using Coursier
    it's not fully clear which is actually being installed and users at times
    are met with very slight differences between the launchers that are
    extremely difficult for newcomers and at times veterans to spot, unless the
    user is knowledgeable about the slight differences between launchers. The [sbt
    documentation](https://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html) makes no mention of
    Coursier being an official way to download the _official_ launcher.
- Scala 2 is installed by default, but not Scala 3. Is there a reason for this?

#### Potential solutions

- Align on the exact application versions that are being installed. If it's not the default
    sbt launcher, there should be an incredibly good reason that it's not. If
    one searches the various Scala help channels it is easy to find examples of
    people tripping up on this issue.
- Which default applications are installed with Coursier? Does the current set
    make sense? Should they include any more to make an even smoother getting
    started experience? This should be discussed, agreed upon, and updated.

## Cost

In level of difficulty we estimate the following order (from easiest to hardest):

1. Unify the Scala website installation instructions
2. Clarify and agree on the applications in `cs setup`
3. Improve the Courser CLI user experience

We estimate that given six months, a single engineer should be able to make substantial progress on all three.

## Timescales

We see unifying the Scala website installation instructions as something that
could be done rather quickly. Parts of clarifying and agreeing on what
applications are included in `cs setup` should also be somewhat quick unless
there specific reasons for a specific distribution of an application being used.
For example, if there is a technical reason as to why the official sbt launcher
can't be included vs the Courser based sbt launcher.

The final proposal of improving the CLI user experience will be the most time
consuming as it will require research and probably a refactoring of the CLI
module in Coursier.

## Closing notes

We wish to reiterate how important Coursier has become in the Scala community. We
also wish to take a moment to identify the incredible work and
dedication Alex Archambault has put into this project. This proposal is not
meant to reflect a frustration with Coursier at all, but rather to further
solidify it as the default way to get started with Scala, and to do everything we
can to ensure that process is smooth, clear, and enjoyable.
