NOTE: There are some missing emails here since I switched jobs during this time
and lost the initial communication since it was tied to my work email. However,
it was pretty standard, asking the board to vote when they'd be available to
meet. The following is picking back up with my new email.

Hello Everyone,

I hope this reaches you all well. As a follow-up to the voting, it looks like
next week Thursday the 25 will work the best for everyone. Please put it on your
calendar!  As always, don't hesitate to reach out if there is anything that
you'd like to add to the agenda, which will be forthcoming.
